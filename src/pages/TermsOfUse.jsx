      <h2>LIABILITY</h2>
      <p>
        9.1 – Principle a/ The MERCHANT explicitly acknowledges and agrees that
        MTGINTERFACE has a simple due care obligation for all its obligations
        arising from the Terms and Conditions. b/ Except in the event of proven
        gross or intentional misconduct, the overall liability of MTGINTERFACE
        to the MERCHANT by virtue of these Terms and Conditions, irrespective of
        the legal grounds may not, if applicable, exceed the amounts already
        paid by the MERCHANT for their last monthly payment. Furthermore, the
        MERCHANT may not claim any compensation in this regard if a claim is not
        made by registered post with return receipt sent to MTGINTERFACE within
        one (1) week as of the date when the underlying event happens. c/ The
        MERCHANT explicitly agrees that MTGINTERFACE and/or its representatives
        have only limited liability (in accordance with article 10.1 /b above)
        to it for (1) any indirect damages arising through the poor performance
        or non-performance by MTGINTERFACE of its obligations by virtue of this
        document resulting in, but not limited to, any losses of profits or
        income and/or any damage arising from the impossibility of using all or
        part of the SERVICE, interruptions to business or other, even if
        MTGINTERFACE or its representatives have been informed of the
        possibility of such damage, (2) any service or assistance no
        specifically included in these Terms and Conditions, (3) any damages
        arising, directly or indirectly, from the inaccuracy of the information
        coming from the use of the SERVICE. d/ The MERCHANT acknowledges that
        they alone are responsible for the information they hold and/or own, as
        well as that arising from the use of the SERVICE, and assume sole
        responsibility for keeping such information. e/ The MERCHANT
        acknowledges that it alone is responsible for forecasting and
        calculating any damage it is liable to suffer in the event of any
        problem arising in the performance of the Terms and Conditions whose
        terms (including financial measures) have been set with regard to the
        liability limitations and exemptions enjoyed by MTGINTERFACE. As a
        consequence, the MERCHANT acknowledges and accepts that it is their own
        responsibility to insure themselves against all risks and that they
        alone deem appropriate with regard to their own individual situation and
        under the terms of the Terms and Conditions. f/ All sales made by the
        merchant on the AMAZON platform, particularly where MTGINTERFACE puts
        optimum prices online on the MERCHANT’s behalf as part of the role with
        which the latter has entrusted it in Article 4, are made directly
        between the merchant and the buyers on AMAZON. As a consequence, (i)
        MTGINTERFACE is under no circumstances a contractual party to agreements
        signed between the MERCHANT and the buyers on AMAZON, and (ii) The
        merchant undertakes to respect the applicable legislative and regulatory
        provisions and particularly those aimed at consumer protection and mail
        order sales. 9.2 – Reliance on AMAZON third party technology a/ The
        MERCHANT explicitly acknowledges that it is aware of and agrees to: –
        the SERVICE relying on « web service » technology developed by AMAZON
        and made available to Marketplace merchants. The MERCHANT undertakes
        only to use information obtained thanks to the SERVICE with the aim of
        optimising their prices on AMAZON, in accordance with these General
        Conditions and with the provisions of the Terms and Conditions and the
        AMAZON Marketplace and Seller Central Participation Agreements. – some
        changes made by AMAZON could render the SERVICE obsolete, independently
        of the monitoring and the desires of MTGINTERFACE, and that this latter
        may under no circumstances be held responsible for developments governed
        by AMAZON and their consequences, whether they arise with or without
        warning and irrespective of the consequences of these changes. b/
        MTGINTERFACE acquits itself of all responsibility as to the integrity,
        exhaustiveness, precision, accuracy, and updating of information and
        data provided by the SERVICE depending on AMAZON and its software and
        databases. MTGINTERFACE holds no intellectual property or other rights
        over AMAZON information and data. This information and data remain the
        exclusive property of AMAZON, as is explicitly acknowledged by the
        MERCHANT, who shall take this into account in their usage. c/
        MTGINTERFACE shall make every effort available to it to make sure the
        SERVICE provides the most up-to-date possible information. However, the
        MERCHANT explicitly acknowledges and agrees that: – the information
        relating to prices are by their very nature volatile, and therefore that
        the optimum prices proposed as part of this SERVICE may no longer be up
        to date when the MERCHANT puts their prices online on Amazon; – by
        clicking on the « Send to Amazon » button, the MERCHANT takes
        responsibility for the prices the put online The abovementioned
        guarantee and liability limitations constitute essential and overriding
        factors of the TERMS AND Conditions between MTGINTERFACE and the
        MERCHANT.
